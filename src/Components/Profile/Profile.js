      <p>
        Hey! My names Sean Slicer, I’ve been learning front end development for
        a couple years now from my self-inclined learning to my general and
        specialty classes at Olathe Northwest. I was accepted into the 21st
        century program e-comm and I took the web design, video production,
        graphic design, and animation classes. In the classes I dealt with
        fast-paced learning and strict project deadlines. I’m now speeding up my
        learning at Centriq and I’ve been learning all key pieces to full stack
        development. I’ve been creating projects and learning a ton of tips and
        tricks on how to refactor programs and create a presentable project at
        any point in its building and I’m continuing to learn on my own, and in
        class. I have a LinkedIn for you to connect with that showcases majority
        my projects and skills.
